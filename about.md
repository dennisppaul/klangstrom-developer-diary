*Klangstrom* (KLST) is an infrastructure to facilitate generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition. *Klangstrom* is comprised of two software libraries ( *Klang* a node+text-based sound synthesis library and *Strom* a node+text-based generative composition library ), an embedded hardware platform, and a programming environment to allow seamless development of generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition applications.

The following (sub)projects are part of *Klangstrom*:

- [Klangstrom for Arduino](https://klangstrom-for-arduino.dennisppaul.de)
- [Klang Teensy Audio Library](https://github.com/dennisppaul/klang-teensy)
- [Klangstrom Hardware](https://github.com/dennisppaul/klangstrom-hardware)

*Klangstrom* is developed and maintained by [Jacob Remin](http://www.jacobremin.com) and [Dennis P Paul](https://dennisppaul.de).
