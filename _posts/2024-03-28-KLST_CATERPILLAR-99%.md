KLST_CATERPILLAR has arrived. it is almost perfect.

so what s the missing 1%? while enjoying the swift design process, i removed the battery module to make the board smaller. in the process i forgot to connect the USB-C 5V net to the board’s power net. lucky i was able to bridge connect the net with a tiny wire, a soldering iron and a bit of patience.

i guess the silkscreen is still valid ;)

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; font-size: 48px; color: #FFF; background-color: #000; line-height: 54px; margin: 0 0 28px 0;"><br/><br/>傲慢と無知<br/><br/><br/></div>

apart from this, everything i tested so far works just fine. most notably the audio codec which is now powered with 1.8V and the MEMS microphones which are connected via DFSDM interface.
