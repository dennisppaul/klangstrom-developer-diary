18 days later … KLST_SHEEP has arrived!

hoooray! the new boards have arrived from JLCPCB today:

- 7 days in production
- 2 days on the road
- 8 days in customs
- 1 day for delivery

at first glance they look really nice and i am  v excited to see them in action. however, i spotted some problems already:

- pin holes for NHD-C12864 display are not drilled through
- SD-Card + USB connectors + audio connectors are not fitted ( the footprint were wrongly marked as THT and thus excluded from the positioning file when exported from KiCAD #mentalnote )
