after i was soooo shocked how cool the [Dirtywave M8 Tracker](https://dirtywave.com) is, while at the same time finding out that M8 is using the source code of Mutable Instrument’s [Braids](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids/) module, i spent the morning crafting two klangstrom nodes that interface with [Braids](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids/) and [Plaits](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/).

on the one hand it kind of makes a point i repeatedly ( want to ) make about klangstrom: it is an *infrastructure* to integrate one’s own or other people’s ideas into. on the other hand, it feels a bit like cheating. IMHO Mutable Instrument’s work is extremly good. boom!

it is also totally worth noting that i have the bare minimum, just enough to see if and how it works and to make the point. the modules can produce sounds alright but there is a lot left to be integrated ( parameters, signals, … ).

@edit i spent another few hours to also add [Clouds](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/) as it was dearly requested by our *head of modular department* ( aka jacob ) … and i must say jacob was right: it s a truely amazing echo machine.
