released the arduino library [Klang Teensy Audio Library](https://github.com/dennisppaul/klang-teensy) which makes the *Klang* library available as an *audio object* in [Teensy Audio Library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html).

although this not the main focus of *Klang* ( or *Klangstrom* for that matter ) it illustrates nicely that *Klang* is a *ubiquitous* audio processing library and how it can be used in various audio DSP contexts.
