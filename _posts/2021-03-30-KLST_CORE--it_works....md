â€¦ mostly.   

unfortunately i already found issues:

- issue #1: the mapping from schemtaic to footprint for the power switch (5/12V) was wrong â€¦ so that does not work â€¦ luckily i added a jumper â€¦ so that it is possible to work around that.
- issue #2: there are two USB ports â€¦ apparently only one is for programming via DFU mode ( which is needed for arduino ). i picked the wrong one ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ luckily again with a vagina-vagina USB cable it s possible to use that *wrong* port for programming 

well, well as jacob says: "this is only the first version â€¦Â we should be happy about this!"
