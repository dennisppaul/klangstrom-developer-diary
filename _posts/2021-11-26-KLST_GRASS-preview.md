battery and prototyping expansion board for KLST_SHEEP

i have just finished the circuit design of a new *extension board* for the KLST_SHEEP called KLST_GRASS. it features a battery clip ( for 18650 cells ), a USB recharger, and a prototyping area. the expansion board can be plugged into the back of a KLST_SHEEP.
