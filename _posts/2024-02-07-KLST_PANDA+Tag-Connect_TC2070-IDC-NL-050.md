despite being a bit of a tiny detail i am quite happy to see that the [Tag-Connect TC2070-IDC-NL-050](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2070-idc-nl) cable works just fine. it is such a nice way to program boards without having to equip a, sometimes expensive and space-consuming, STDC14 connector.

PS { KLST_PANDA has a non-shrouded STDC14 connector on the back though … it is a bit easier and reliable to connect to. however, in setups with where not sooo much development needs to happen the PCB-based-no-component alternative is worth considering. }
